    <title>Dakhota Omniciye – Truth-telling Today</title>  

    <body>
        In 2010, MNHS began collecting oral histories from descendants of families impacted by the war,
        both Dakota and settler. Dakota people have spoken of the long-lasting legacy of the war still with
        them, from the dispersal of communities and families, to separation from homelands, and the ongoing
        stigma given to their ancestors for their actions. As Dr. Clifford Canku noted, "They were implicated
        for being Dakota. Just being Dakota means that you were guilty before any consideration of being innocent."

        In 2017, MNHS in partnership with Dakota communities in Minnesota began holding an annual Dakhóta Omníčiye,
        a gathering and truth-telling event, here at Historic Fort Snelling at Bdote. It has been an opportunity for
        Dakota people to reconnect with this place which holds so much important history, and to tell that history
        from their own perspective.
