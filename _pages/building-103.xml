	<title>MISLS</title>

	<body>
		During World War II, the Military Intelligence Service Langauge School (MISLS) trained soldiers in the Japanese language to aid the war effort.
		Since then, many of buildings (including building 103) have fallen into disrepair and are no longer open to the public.
	</body>

	<body>
		To help shine a light on this forgotten history of the fort, we created a virtual museum from 3D scans of the building interior, as well as words
		and images from the soldiers who studied there. If you are interested in learning more about their lives and work, please consider checking out
		our companion app "Virtual MISLS".
