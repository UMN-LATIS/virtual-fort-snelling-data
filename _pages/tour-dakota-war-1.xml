    <title>Incarceration and Exile</title>
    
    <body>
        The war resulted in the state condemning 300 Dakota warriors to a death sentence, 38 of whom were executed by President Lincoln’s order (commuting the sentence of the remainder).
        Over 1,600 Dakota and ‘mixed-blood’ non-combatants were incarcerated under the shadow of the fort during the winter of 1862–3 as they awaited their exile from the state as ordered by the governor of Minnesota, Alexander Ramsey. Conditions in the concentration camp were grim, with an estimated 25% of prisoners dying over the winter (Anderson and Woolworth 1998; Waziyatawin 2008). Mixed-ancestry Dakota in possession of land scrip were forced to relinquish it in exchange for rations and safe passage away from the prison offered by war profiteers (Milliken 2010).

        In the spring of 1863, the incarcerated Dakota were removed by steamboat and sent to reserves in Nebraska and the Dakotas, while Dakota resistors were aggressively hunted by the US military, pushing them north into Canada or west into the Dakotas.
